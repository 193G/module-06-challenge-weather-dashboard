# Weather Dashboard

This is a weather dashboard that allows you to search for current and future weather conditions for any city in the world. The dashboard provides current weather conditions such as the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed. It also provides future weather conditions in a 5-day forecast format that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.
